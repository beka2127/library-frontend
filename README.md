    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  **Ensure the Backend API is running.** (Refer to the main `README.md` for backend setup instructions). The frontend expects the backend to be available at `https://localhost:7086` by default.
2.  **Start the React development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
